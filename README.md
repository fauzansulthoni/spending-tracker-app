# 📦 SpendWise

SpendWise is a personal finance tracker designed to help you take control of your spending, monitor transactions, and build smarter budget plans. This project is a hands-on experiment in modern web development, built with ReactJS to explore UI architecture, state management, and a real-world app.

## 🚧 Limitations & Future Improvements

SpendWise is still a work in progress and far from feature-complete. While the core functionality is in place, there are several areas that I plan to improve as time allows:

- 📉 **No Graphs or Spending Reports Yet**  
  Visual summaries like charts and analytics are not implemented. These could greatly enhance user insight, but time constraints have delayed their development.

- 💱 **Currency Is Fixed to Indonesian Rupiah (Rp)**  
  The currency input is currently static and cannot be changed dynamically. Future updates may include multi-currency support.

- 💬 **Quotes & Budget Insights Are Static**  
  The welcome quote and budget insight do not yet respond to user spending behavior. Dynamic feedback is planned but not yet implemented.

- 🧹 **Missing Utility Features**  
  Features like "Clear Data", notifications, and a detailed privacy policy are on the roadmap but haven’t been built due to limited development time.
